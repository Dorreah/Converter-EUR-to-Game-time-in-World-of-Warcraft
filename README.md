One of my first more advanced project, where I practice logic through conversion euros into game time to the game World of Warcraft.

In the time i was making it the price for 1 month was 12.99 eur. Let's hope it won't increase anytime soon.

I have learned here a basic logic of conversion in javascript and I gotta say the:
"document.getElementById()" stuff and combining it with the right elements and values costed me some nerves.

Practise makes perfect.
Gonna hurt.
